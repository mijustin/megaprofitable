     <h3 align="center">Story: &quot;What happened to your startup?&quot;</h3>
     <p>I was talking to a friend who is the founder of a massively popular SaaS. We're talking thousands of users, tons of press coverage, and millions of dollars in sales.</p>
     <p align="center">

     <p>During our  conversation he turned to me and said:</p>
     <blockquote>&quot;Justin, I had to lay off all my staff.&quot;</blockquote>
     <p>I was shocked.</p>
     <blockquote>&quot;What happened? I thought you had a ton of revenue.&quot;</blockquote>
     <p>He'd run out of cash. The company had high revenues, but even higher expenses. He wasn't generating profits he could invest back in the business.</p>
     <p>He tried to raise another round of capital, but couldn't get investors to bite. So, he had to downsize.</p>
     <h3 align="center">Here's what I learned: revenue is important, but profit is king.</h3>
    <blockquote>"Companies don't go out of business because they run out of sales. They go out of business because they run out of cash."<footnote>- <cite>Thanh Pham</cite></footnote></blockquote>
    <p>For most small businesses, profit is the cash you have leftover in your account at the end of the year. It's the money (after revenue) your business didn't spend.</p>
    <h3 align="center">If you're a founder, I urge you to get profitable</h3>
    <p>It's surprising how many of us feel like we're doing OK. We say things like:</p>
    <blockquote>&quot;The business is doing fine! We're paying our bills.&quot;</blockquote>
    <p>But the truth is, you're probably operating in survival mode, and you don't even know it. Here are some signs that you're not profitable enough:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You don't have 3-6 months cash reserves in the bank</li>
      <li>You're not paying yourself a reasonable founder's salary</li>
      <li>Your expenses increase at the same rate as your revenues</li>
      <li>You need to run last-minute sales to cover your bills</li>
      <li>You don't have enough cash to hire or invest in growth</li>
    </ul>
